# Bright Cloud Studio's Form-to-Form
Allows one form's fields to be pre-filled using submitted values from another.

##Uses:
This package was designed for a client who wanted one small form on their homepage to act as an introduction to a much larger form. When a user enters values into the small form they would be sent to the larger form where those submitted values would then be pre-filled in to the matching form fields.

##Directions:
In this example we have two forms, Form A and Form B. In Form A's settings page, choose Form B as the target for the "Form-to-Form Target" setting.
Any fields on Form B that have matching aliases will be pre-filled with the values entered within Form A.
